# Patient Health Monitering System
Patient Health Monitoring System is a Java based GUI (Graphical User Interface) application that can maintain records of individual patients, their health-related parameters, Doctor’s advice etc. and send reminder to the patient for each clinical test/doctor’s appointment, analyse improvement of his/her health condition. Also sort the patients according to their various parameters. I have kept a database for the patients and even the application is capable of sending sms as a reminder for them to meet the doctors.
